# MLbuilds
Self-study portion of Machine Learning and Data Science with Python

This is my personal repository for uploading my ML Python codes. Source codes are a bit unorganized but I will try to maintain them as soon as possible.
I have added some of the datasets for the models as well.

Thank you for visiting.
